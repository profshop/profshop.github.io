      <h1>About</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This workshop is designed to foster mentorship, education, and collaboration among students who are curious about becoming AR/VR (or XR) faculty someday.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">The workshop will feature panels of current professors discussing various aspects of professorship, including (among other topics) tenure, creating and organizing a research program, teaching, and professional service, and more generally what aspects of their profession they really like and dislike, and why. We will attempt to include professors (on the panels) who have also worked in industry, and therefore have some basis for comparison. Additionally, the workshop will include “speed advising” sessions in which students will be able to have several short advising sessions with current faculty. In this portion, students will have the opportunity to ask more specific questions pertaining to a particular professor's experience while learning from a breadth of experiences. While brief, these meetings will help form relationships between students and professors, and participants can continue their conversations later in the workshop and conference. The panels and speed advising sessions will feature diverse faculty to provide students with various perspectives on the meaning of, success within, and preparation for professorship. Throughout the workshop, there will be an emphasis on creating and sustaining an academic environment that is diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible.

      <h1>Workshop Format</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The ProfShop workshop will consist of multiple panels with group discussions and 1-on-1 mentoring sessions.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">
        Each panel will last for one hour and will be centered on a specific aspect related to being a professor (e.g. a panel on how to manage a research lab, a panel on dealing with the challenges of interdisciplinary research). For each panel, we will have a brief introduction of the panel members and the panel topic, and then move into questions and group discussions. We will have prepared some starter questions to get the discussion going, after which we will open the floor to questions and comments from the workshop attendees. We will recruit professors with the appropriate background to speak on the panel topic (e.g. the panel on differences in universities will include faculty from a range of institutions and countries to best represent the different perspectives on this topic). 
      </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">
        In order to facilitate more personalized discussions, we will also host two “speed advising” sessions. In these sessions, attendees will be paired with a professor for 15 minutes for a 1-on-1 conversation. This conversation gives aspiring professors the opportunity to get advice regarding their specific situations and questions, unlike the more general advice from panel sessions. After each 15 minute session, attendees will be rotated out so that more people can get the chance to speak to a professor.
